  description: >
    The Configuration Framework Service (CFS) manages the launch of Ansible Execution Environments
    for image customization, node personalization, and node reconfiguration. CFS manages
    the Ansible staging container that pulls Ansible play/role content and inventory (optional)
    from the git server and launches the Ansible Execution Environment.


    CFS includes the following components:

      * CFS REST API
      * A Kubernetes operator running on the management services infrastructure to handle
      the lifecycle and reporting of configuration sessions.
      * Pre-packaged Ansible Execution Environment(s) (AEE) with values tuned for performant
      configuration for executing Ansible playbooks against Cray compute and user access nodes.


    CFS uses a Git version control server running in the management services infrastructure
    for management of the configuration manifest lifecycle.


      The CFS API allows an administrator to customize the compute and user access nodes
      in the following ways:
    * Customize the bootable images prior to their use on the system. This process is called
      image customization. CFS uses IMS to stage images in an ssh container and then modifies
      one or more images using Ansible.

    * Customize live nodes during boot or post-boot. This process is called node personalization.
      Node personalization involves applying software and/or configuration that differentiates
      a node or a group of nodes from all other groups of nodes.
      This should be used in scenarios where configuration cannot be applied prior to booting
      a node. It is typically best to make changes pre-boot via image customization. This ensures
      Ansible only has to run once against an image, rather than against every individual booted node.
      The BOS and IMS APIs support CFS to customize live nodes during boot time.

    ## Resources

    /healthz - Check service health


    /options - Updates service options.


    /sessions - Create, retrieve, or delete configuration sessions.


    /components - Add, update, retrieve, or delete component information.


    /configurations - Add, update, retrieve or delete desired configuration states.


    /sources - Add, update, retrieve, or delete playbook source information. (v3 api only)

    ## Workflows

    ### Image Customization

     #### GET /images

     Identify the IMS image that you want to customize. Note the id of the image that you want to customize.

     #### POST /sessions

     Create a configuration session and push the configuration to the specific image in IMS.
     You must specify the target definition as image and provide id of the image that you want to customize.
     This step customizes the image as per Ansible playbook and saves the image in the IMS.


    ### Node Personalization

     #### POST /sessions
     Create a configuration framework session to push configuration to nodes that have already
     been booted, specifying the target (optional), the git repository location, inventory (optional),
     and gives the session a unique name.

     #### GET /sessions/{session_name}
     View details and status for the specific session_name.

     #### DELETE /sessions/{session_name}
     Delete all session history for session_name (as needed).

    The default content type for the CFS API is `application/json`. Unsuccessful
    API calls return a content type of `application/problem+json` as per RFC 7807.

           A target lets you define the nodes or images that you want to customize and consists
           of two sub-parameters - Definition and groups.
           By default, Configuration Framework Sessions use dynamic inventory definition
           to target hosts. When using a session to customize an image, or if a static inventory
           is required, use this optional section to specify entities (whether images or nodes)
           for the session to target.
      properties:
        definition:
          type: string
          description: |
            Source of inventory definition to be used in the configuration session.

            'image' denotes that the session will target an image root through the Image
            Management Service (IMS). Group members should be a single image identifier known by IMS.

            'spec' denotes inventory that is specified directly via CFS in the target
            groups/members of this object. You can include a node name (a DNS resolvable name),
            or a group name and a list of nodes. The command line inventory can be a quick
            and simple way to run Ansible against a small subset of nodes. However, if more
            customization of the inventory is needed, specifically customization of host and
            groups variables, the repo target definition should be used.

            'repo' denotes the inventory will be used from the git repository
            specified for this session (via `cloneUrl`, and `branch` or `commit`). The inventory
            must be located in the "hosts" file at the root of the repository.

            'dynamic' (default) will use the CFS-provided dynamic inventory plugin to define
            the inventory. The hosts file is automatically generated by CFS with data from
            the Hardware State Manager (HSM), which includes groups and hardware roles.

        Create a new configuration session. A configuration session stages Ansible inventory,
        launches one or more Ansible Execution Environments (AEE) as containers in the management
        services infrastructure, and tears down the environments as required. When a session is
        targeted for image customization, the inventory staging involves using IMS to expose the requested
        image roots, tearing down the image roots, and generating new boot artifacts afterwards.
        The session will checkout the prescribed branch or commit of the configuration repository
        and populate the configuration manifest to the AEE. The Ansible execution begins with an
        inventory prescribed by the user through CFS. A configuration session also tracks the
        status of the different stages of the operation and reports information on
        the success of its execution.

        Create a new configuration session. A configuration session stages Ansible inventory,
        launches one or more Ansible Execution Environments (AEE) as containers in the management
        services infrastructure, and tears down the environments as required. When a session is
        targeted for image customization, the inventory staging involves using IMS to expose the requested
        image roots, tearing down the image roots, and generating new boot artifacts afterwards.
        The session will checkout the prescribed branch or commit of the configuration repository
        and populate the configuration manifest to the AEE. The Ansible execution begins with an
        inventory prescribed by the user through CFS. A configuration session also tracks the
        status of the different stages of the operation and reports information on
        the success of its execution.

        Restore a CFS source by providing the name of the Vault secret that contains the credentials.
        This does NOT create the secret in Vault, nor does it validate that the secret exists.
        This is intended to be used to restore CFS data in the case that it is lost or corrupted.
        This will NOT recover a source that has been deleted using CFS, because when CFS deletes a
        source, it also deletes its corresponding Vault secret.
        NOTE: This action is not available prior to CFS 1.23
